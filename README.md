# NsqMon
NSQ monitoring tool for Windows. Like nsqadmin with sums and sorting.

## Project Status

- Abandoned. Pull Requests and Issues will probably be ignored.
- Originally I wanted to make a SoapUI/Postman like interface for NSQ.
- Turns out, all I cared about was a quick view of the depth of topics/channels across a cluster and stopped there.
- Enjoy!
